## Internship Goals

### Side learnings
- [x] Basic understanding of Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Neo4J, CouchDB) in context of CRUD operatopns and Aggregation queries.
- [x] Basic understanding of Docker commands and docker compose. [![link](https://stackify.com/docker-tutorial/)]
- [x] Working with Python packages(database clients, __networkx__ and other basic ones) [![link](https://networkx.org/)]
- [ ] Understanding of __Data lineage discovery__ and __Data Integration__ basic concepts (some solutions in general):
- [ ] Understanding and development of __GraphQL__ and __REST API__

### Main objective
- [ ] Explore different implementation for Feature comparision and performance benchmarking module of SuggestDb.
- [x] Re-designing performance benchmarking scripts in Python for MongoDb, CouchDb, Neo4J and PostgreS database.
- [ ] Re-designing and put NoSQL performance benchmarking scripts in a docker.
- [ ] Working on Airflow pipeline to make schedule run of SuggestDb scripts.

### Bonus Point Objective
- [ ] Running Aurum on __DISQ__ data
- [ ] Scheme to improve profiler of Aurum to accomodate __column data ontologies__
- [ ] Development of a wrapper package (Python and R) around Aurum.
- [ ] Understanding __Aurum paper__ and work contributed by BASF [![link](https://github.com/mitdbg/aurum-datadiscovery/blob/master/knowledgerepr/fieldnetwork.py)]
- [ ] Extending project to get and store column similarity scores to Neo4J (currently missing) [![link](https://github.com/mitdbg/aurum-datadiscovery/blob/master/knowledgerepr/fieldnetwork.py)]
- [ ] Extending projoject to capture wisdom of crowd
- [ ] Developing script to add additional edge properties to Neo4J Column __similarity graph__ (generated by Aurum) 
- [ ] Building an API (only design) to execute pipeline for Data Integration
### Minimum expected result
